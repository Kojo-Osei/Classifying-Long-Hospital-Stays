# <b> Long Hospital Inpatient Stay Classification </b>

Analyzing hospital discharge data for Medicare and Medicare-eligible beneficiaries from the New York's Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS), I build a machine learning classification model to predict which hospital inpatient stays will exceed Medicare's 90 covered inpatient days.

This prediction model will provide multiple benefits to hospitals and Medicare beneficiaries, including:
* helping identify which patients may require further counseling on additional costs they may incur for longer stays in the hospital, and which patients might benefit from having additional coverage for their cost-sharing
* helping identify newly admitted patients who may need to stay in their hospital bed for extended periods of time, allowing hospitals to plan accordingly for hospital capacity
